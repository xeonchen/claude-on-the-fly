# terminal, and the terminal is what the tmux pane mirrors — so the flag buys a
# parser and costs the live view. Reading the rollout instead serves both arms
# from one source, which is also the only way the hosted and unhosted arms can be
# guaranteed to report a turn identically.
#
# The rollout names items in PascalCase where the `--json` stream used
# snake_case, so this is a second vocabulary rather than the same one. Both sets
# are observed, not guessed: this one comes from every item type present across
# 400 local rollouts (Reasoning, CommandExecution, AgentMessage,
# CollabAgentToolCall, UserMessage, FileChange, Extension, ImageView,
# ContextCompaction). An unknown type counts as a tool, which is the safe

    both, so neither stream can be added to the other, and neither can be read

    than one command per call, so items outnumbered calls on 113 of the 602

    a `response_item` call_id, so that pair joins exactly. Anything the local

    lossy angles, so the larger of the two readings is taken. That cannot
    double-count a call both streams reported, and it cannot report zero while
    either stream holds a record.

    An item names its own count, because an item type (`CommandExecution`) is
    what this footer has always shown. A call only names the shortfall the item

    The pane runs the **interactive** binary, not `codex exec`. That is the whole

    shows plain lines rather than the agent's screen, and the pane reads as dead
    next to claude-pty's. Interactive codex draws its own UI, and the mirror shows
    exactly what somebody sitting at the terminal would see.

    Two things follow from that, and they are why this arm is not just a different
    argv:

    - **It never exits.** The TUI returns to its prompt when the turn is done and
      waits for the next one. So the end of a turn is read from the rollout
      (`task_complete`, via the follower) rather than from a process exit, and the
      session is killed once it lands. A `tmux wait-for` on the command finishing
      would never fire here, which is why this polls rather than blocks.
    - **There is no exit code.** A turn that completed is a success by definition,
      because the reply is already in the rollout. A pane that vanished before
      completing is the failure, and the tap explains it.

    Every tmux call goes through `tmux.argv_prefix()`. Addressing the server by
    name rather than by `TMUX_TMPDIR` is what stops an inherited `TMUX` -- which a
    daemon started inside the operator's tmux has -- from putting the pane on the

        Codex has two compaction paths and neither is a command we can send.
        `thread/compact/start` belongs to the app-server protocol, which `exec`
        doesn't speak. And typing `/compact` as a prompt is worse than useless:
        `exec` *recognizes* it (a bogus slash command answers "Unknown command")
        and replies "Context compacted." — but the context does not change.
        Measured across a real thread, 45,730 → 46,335 → 46,357 tokens, and the
        rollout gains none of the compaction bookkeeping the binary defines. The
        turn compacts in memory and `exec` exits without writing it back, so the
        next `resume` rebuilds from an untouched rollout.

        What does work is the threshold codex checks for itself before a turn:
        `run_auto_compact` lives in exec's own code path. Passing a limit far
        below the current context via `-c` makes that check fire on this turn
        only, leaving the user's `~/.codex/config.toml` alone. Same thread, that
        took 46,357 → 18,507 and it survived later plain resumes.

        The cost is that codex compaction needs a turn to hang off, so it spends
        one cheap exchange where claude spends none.

# Backends

Two agent CLIs are supported: `claude` (default) and `codex`. The dispatch layer is `src/claude_on_the_fly/agent.py`; each backend lives in `src/claude_on_the_fly/backends/`.

## Contract

Every backend implements the `AgentBackend` Protocol at `src/claude_on_the_fly/agent.py:594`:

- `run(workspace, session_uuid, prompt, platform, user_name, channel_context, timeout) -> Response` — execute one turn
- `takeover_command(workspace, session_uuid) -> str | None` — interactive resume command, or `None` if no session yet
- `session_log_path(workspace, session_uuid) -> Path | None` — live JSONL for the TUI's live view to tail, or `None`
- `list_skills() -> list[tuple[str, str]]` — `(name, description)` pairs for the Slack picker; empty when the backend has no skill concept

A new backend means: implement the protocol, add a builder in `agent.py:_build_*_backend()` (see `_build_claude_backend` at `agent.py:786`), and add the env-driven switch in `get_backend()` at `agent.py:706`.

## Behavioral differences that affect integration code

These are the differences that *downstream* code (footer, orchestrator, TUI) has to compensate for. If you change one, grep for the comment header below.

### Cost

- **claude** (`backends/claude.py`): native CLI emits cost in the JSONL — use it as-is.
- **codex** (`backends/codex.py:370`): no cost field. Pricing layer at `src/claude_on_the_fly/pricing.py` looks up models in OpenRouter's registry, multiplies by tokens. Cache at `~/.claude-on-the-fly/pricing/openrouter.json`, TTL 7 days (`agent.pricing_ttl_seconds`).
- **claude under `ollama`**: also priced from that registry, because the CLI's `total_cost_usd` comes from Anthropic's table for a model Anthropic isn't serving.

`cost_for` prices four **non-overlapping** buckets: plain input, output, cache reads, cache writes. The cache arguments default to 0, which is what keeps codex (no prompt caching at all) billing identically. Don't feed it `Response.tokens_in` — that folds cache reads in for the footer's `↑N`, so passing it alongside `cache_read_tokens` bills those twice at the dearer rate. `_billable_usage` in the claude backend exists to keep the two apart.

Cache rates fall back to the *prompt* rate when a model publishes none (184 of 342 registry entries publish `input_cache_read`, only 55 publish `input_cache_write`), because for those a cache write genuinely is billed as ordinary input — falling back to zero would make the largest term on a cold thread free. A published `0` is honoured as free. Reading only `prompt`/`completion`, as this did originally, understated a measured turn by 39-43% across the models in use: cache writes were dropped entirely while cache reads were billed at up to 10x their real rate, so the two errors didn't cancel.

### Session resume

- **claude**: `--resume <uuid>` works for both create and resume.
- **codex**: assigns its own `thread_id`. Persist the authenticated mapping in the
  daemon-owned `~/.claude-on-the-fly/codex-sessions/` store after the first turn, then
  `resume <thread_id>` on follow-ups. The store is outside the agent-writable workspace,
  reads reject symlinks, and new records are atomic owner-only (`0600`) files.
  A mapping is only a thread id, so `codex_state.adopt_rollout` checks the rollout is in
  the `CODEX_HOME` this spawn will use, copying it out of the shared tree when
  `sandbox.scope_sessions` has moved the home under it. When there is no rollout left to
  adopt the mapping is dead: it is cleared and the turn starts a new thread with the
  system prompt and the handoff, because `resume` on a missing rollout fails the turn
  outright (`thread/resume failed: no rollout found for thread id`).

### Tool / skill counts (footer display)

- **claude**: skills populated by CLI; tools from `tool_use` blocks.
- **codex**: no skill concept in the footer (`skill_counts` always empty). Tools from the rollout's `item_completed` events, which name items in PascalCase (`CommandExecution`, `FileChange`). `Reasoning`, `UserMessage`, `AgentMessage` and `ContextCompaction` are what the turn did rather than tools it called, so they are excluded; an unknown type counts as a tool, so a new one appears in the footer rather than vanishing. `list_skills()` scans `$CODEX_HOME/prompts/*.md` for the picker.

### Interim progress

When enabled, native and Ollama turns from both backends can forward mid-turn
narration through the shared progress sink. Claude consumes its stream line by line
in `agent._consume`; Codex follows its rollout file (`_RolloutFollower`), polling it
once a second while the turn runs. An `AgentMessage` carries a `phase`, so narration is
read from the producer rather than inferred: `commentary` is forwarded, `final_answer` is
not, because `Response.body` posts that one once as the answer. The existing
`InterimProgress` relay then applies its warm-up and pacing policy.

Progress delivery is best effort: a parser or frontend failure is logged and never
turns a successful agent run into an error. Claude pty has no line-oriented stream,
and Telegram still inherits the frontend no-op, so both remain unsupported.

### Where codex's machine data comes from

A hosted codex turn runs the **interactive** binary rather than `codex exec`, so the
pane mirrors codex's own UI; see [panes](panes.md). Either way it runs **without
`--json`**. The flag would put the same events on stdout, but a
`--json` run renders JSONL into the terminal, and the terminal is what the pane mirrors
(see [panes](panes.md)) — so it buys a parser and costs the live view.

Everything is read from the rollout instead, by `parse_codex_rollout`:

| Needed | Rollout record |
|---|---|
| thread id | `session_meta.session_id` |
| the reply | `event_msg/task_complete.last_agent_message` |
| turn finished | `event_msg/task_complete` present |
| turn failed | `event_msg/turn_aborted.reason` |
| tool counts | `event_msg/item_completed.item.type` |
| usage fallback | `event_msg/token_count.info.last_token_usage` |

Usage and the context reading already came from the rollout before this, so the numbers
in the footer did not move.

One parser serves both the hosted and the unhosted arm. That is the point: two readers of
one turn drift, and a hosted turn reporting differently from an unhosted one would be
invisible until somebody compared them.

The rollout is append-only across `codex exec resume`, so the follower records the file's
size before the spawn and reads only what arrives after it. Parsing from the top would
fold an earlier turn's tool counts and final message into this one.

### System prompt

- **claude**: `--system-prompt` flag.
- **codex**: no flag — format hint is prepended to each user message.

### Permission mode

- **claude**: `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` (per the experimental warning in README).
- **codex**: no flag — built-in tools (`read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`) all enabled by default.

### Image input

Both: frontends save images to workspace, agent reads through its own file tooling. No `-i` flag or equivalent. Models are multimodal.

## Rough performance footprint

Rough numbers from one cold turn (a trivial one-word prompt, no tools) driven through `ollama launch <cli> --model deepseek-v4-flash:cloud` so both backends hit the same model — this isolates per-CLI overhead from model differences. n=2, single machine; wall time includes the `ollama launch` spawn and the cloud round-trip, so absolute times are network-dependent. **Treat the relative ordering as the signal, not the exact figures.**

| Backend  | Wall / cold turn | Peak process-tree RSS | Context the CLI injects | CLI runtime |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| claude   | ~4–5s            | ~430 MB               | ~33.5k tokens           | Node        |
| codex    | ~10–13s          | ~175 MB               | ~26.8k tokens           | Rust        |

Reading it:

- **Latency:** codex is the slower and more variable of the two.
- **Memory:** codex is lighter (Rust binary, ~175 MB vs claude's ~430 MB Node tree). The Python daemon baseline is ~28 MB, so the rest is the CLI tree.
- **Context overhead** (tokens each CLI prepends before the user prompt) drives per-turn cost: for this one-word reply, both landed at ~$0.0026–0.0033 on deepseek pricing.

Warm resumes are faster than these cold numbers and skip the first-turn system-prompt re-send.

## Where the model and the effort come from

One resolver decides, and the backends consume its answer. `agent.resolve_profile(name)`
returns a frozen `AgentProfile(backend, mode, model, effort, ollama_context_window)`
with every value already routed, and `agent.get_backend(profile)` binds the model and
the effort onto the backend it constructs. Nothing below that line reads `settings`
for any of the four.

Two things depend on that.

**The routing lives in one place.** Which key owns the effort depends on the mode:
under a launcher it is `agent.ollama.effort`, otherwise the backend's own. The model
is suppressed entirely under a launcher, since `ollama launch … --model X` already
pinned it and a second `--model` would be a dead flag on the wrapped argv. Both
backends used to re-derive that, and `current_backend_key` derived it a third time.

**A per-job override is safe under concurrency.** The worker runs several jobs as
asyncio tasks in one interpreter. The answer travels as an argument from
`jobs/agent_runner.py` through `agent.run(profile=…)` into the constructor, so two
jobs cannot read each other's. Any design that swapped process-global settings around
the call would be a data race, which is why the profile is a value and not ambient
state.

**codex applies the effort in pty mode too.** `-c` is a global codex option, not an
`exec` one, so both argv builders pass it and `_effort_args` resolves it once for both.
Verified by driving the interactive TUI under tmux with `-c model_reasoning_effort="low"`
against a `config.toml` saying `medium`: codex's own statusline read `gpt-5.6-luna low`,
and a `resume` with `xhigh` on the same thread reported `xhigh`. Claude pty is the
exception and stays one, for the reason at `backends/claude.py:541-544`: whether
interactive claude honours `--effort` is untested, and a flag it silently ignores is
worse than no flag.

`AgentProfile.key` is the `backend:mode:model` string that seeds session uuids. It is
a wire format: codex substitutes `default` for an empty model and claude does not, and
that asymmetry is preserved deliberately because changing the rendering would restart
every session an earlier build wrote.

## Transport modes

### ollama launch

Wraps the agent CLI in `ollama launch <agent> --model <X> --yes --`. Implementation: `OllamaLauncher` at `src/claude_on_the_fly/agent.py:636`. Triggered by `agent.claude.mode: ollama` / `agent.codex.mode: ollama`. Requires `ollama` installed and target model pulled (`ollama pull <name>`). Session resume, tool use, and Skills behave identically to native mode — only the model provider changes. For claude, the footer cost reflects Ollama's billing (`:cloud` models) or `$0` (local).

### pty (claude only)

Drives `claude-pty` from [claude-interactive-p](https://github.com/CJHwong/claude-interactive-p) under a PTY, surfacing `ctx N%` and `5h N% → HH:MM` in the footer (fields `claude -p` doesn't expose). Wall-clock ~1–2s slower per turn. Doctor surfaces three stale-install failure modes: missing `claude-pty` binary, missing `jq`, or missing Stop-hook / statusline-shim wiring in `~/.claude/settings.json`. Tool/skill counts are not surfaced in pty mode.

**pty spawns trust their workspace first.** claude records a per-directory trust decision and skips the dialog only in non-interactive mode — `-p`, or a non-TTY stdout ([`claude --help`](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-reference), verified on 2.1.220). Native mode therefore never sees it and pty always does, because handing claude a TTY is what pty is for. An untrusted directory does not fail the turn, it stops on `❯ 1. Yes, I trust this folder` and waits for a keystroke nobody sends, so the turn ends at the caller's timeout with no output. No flag suppresses it interactively and no subcommand grants it (`claude project` only purges), which leaves claude's own project-state file as the only lever. `pty_install.ensure_workspace_trusted` sets `projects.<workspace>.hasTrustDialogAccepted` there as the first statement of `_exec_pty`, before the spawn — after would be useless, since claude waits rather than failing.

Bounded three ways. Only paths under `DATA_DIR/workspaces` qualify (`cotf_owns_workspace` resolves before comparing, so `..` cannot smuggle one in), so a session pointed at an operator's own checkout is left alone. Only that one key is written, through a temp file and `os.replace` at `0600`, and a state file that fails to parse is reported rather than replaced — the file is claude's, reaches megabytes, and rewriting it from a failed parse would discard the lot. `st_mtime_ns` is compared before the replace and the read retried (three attempts) when it moved, because claude rewrites this file on its own schedule; that is a re-read, not a lock, since claude takes no lock either. A successful grant is memoized per process, so a daemon does not re-parse a megabyte per turn.

It grants no privilege: cotf created the directory and already runs claude with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`. The seatbelt jail and the approval gate are the controls, and neither is touched. Two limits worth knowing: on the first-run path where the file does not exist yet there is no mtime to compare, so a file claude creates inside that window would be overwritten; and the process memo does not notice a trust key stripped by hand, which stays memoized until restart. A failed grant is logged and the spawn proceeds anyway, degrading to the old hang rather than refusing the turn.

**The state file is not inside `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` by default.** It is `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json` when that variable is set, and `~/.claude.json` at *home root* when it is not — not `~/.claude/.claude.json`, which on a machine that once set the variable may exist as an unrelated stale file with no `projects` key at all. `pty_install.claude_state_file` encodes that split and resolves the variable through `envfile`, so it reads what the daemon receives rather than what the viewing shell exports.

**Compaction under pty needs claude-interactive-p's `PostCompact` hook.** claude-pty's envelope is written by its **Stop** hook, and a compaction fires no Stop hook: it produces no assistant message. Without a second writer the envelope never appears, the TUI drops back to waiting for input, and claude-pty's poll loop has no wall-clock cap of its own — so the run only ends when the caller's timeout does, an hour by default. `hooks/postcompact_envelope.sh` writes it instead, gated on `trigger == "manual"`: Claude Code's *own* mid-turn compaction lands as `trigger: "auto"` while the real turn is still running, and an envelope there would end the turn early and return the summary in place of the answer. `checks.check_pty_hooks` warns (does not block) when the hook is absent, so an older install keeps running ordinary turns and only loses compaction.

`ClaudeBackend.compact` runs in whichever mode the backend is in — no cross-mode shortcut. Reaching for `claude -p` from a pty backend would forfeit what pty is for (an operator can `tmux attach` to a live turn, and a compaction is the longest, priciest thing a thread does, so the worst one to make invisible), and the two resolve their own effort / fast-mode / output-style settings, so a `-p` compaction could summarize a conversation under settings it never ran under.

Whether a compaction happened is reported in-band in both modes, under the same `compact` key. Native `-p` emits `{"type":"system","subtype":"status","status":"compacting"}` and then a `compact_result`, folded in by `agent._fold`; the pty PostCompact hook writes the equivalent subtree into its envelope. Without that signal a compaction is indistinguishable from a turn that died — both end `subtype: "success"` with an empty `result` — which is why `run()` checks for one before reaching for `NUDGE_PROMPT`. The token numbers come from the transcript either way, out of the newest `compact_boundary` record's `compactMetadata` (`preTokens` / `postTokens` / `durationMs`); those count the conversation, not the billed prompt, which also carries the uncompactable system prompt and tool schemas.

### Compaction

Both backends compact, by unrelated mechanisms.

**claude** takes `/compact` as a prompt. The CLI intercepts it, emits `status: "compacting"` then a `compact_result`, and writes a `compact_boundary` into the transcript carrying `preTokens` / `postTokens` / `durationMs`. It is a standalone operation: no turn, no reply.

**codex** has no compaction command we can send. `thread/compact/start` belongs to the app-server protocol, which `exec` doesn't speak — and sending `/compact` as a prompt is the trap: `exec` *recognizes* it (a bogus slash command answers `Unknown command`) and replies `Context compacted.`, but the context is untouched. Measured on one thread: 45,730 → 46,335 → 46,357 tokens, with none of the compaction bookkeeping the binary defines appearing in the rollout. The turn compacts in memory and `exec` exits without writing it back, so the next `resume` rebuilds from an unmodified rollout. **Never send it.**

What works is the threshold codex checks itself before each turn (`run_auto_compact`, in exec's own code path). `CodexBackend.compact` passes `-c model_auto_compact_token_limit=<low>` for that one run, so the check fires and the user's `~/.codex/config.toml` is never touched. Same thread: 46,357 → 18,507, and it survived later plain resumes.

Two consequences of codex's route. It needs a turn to hang off, so it spends one cheap exchange where claude spends none. And it publishes no in-band signal, so success is judged by whether the prompt actually shrank — reporting success off the trigger alone would repeat the exact lie `/compact` tells. That also means no duration, which is why `Compaction.summary()` omits the timing when it is absent rather than printing "in 0s".

### Context readings

Both modes report prompt size and window size, which is what the auto-compact gate thresholds on. pty reads them off the statusline (`context_window.total_input_tokens` / `context_window_size`). Native derives them in `_native_context_fields`: all three `usage` terms summed, paired with the widest `modelUsage[…].contextWindow`. codex reports both in its rollout instead of on stdout — `last_token_usage.input_tokens` for the turn's own prompt and `model_context_window` for the window, read by `transcript.extract_codex_prompt_tokens` (which skips the `input_tokens: 0` turn a compaction reports, since that describes the pass rather than the context it left behind). **ollama has none to read**: the claude CLI fills in `contextWindow` from its own table even when ollama is serving another vendor's model (200000 observed for `glm-5.2:cloud`), so the figure describes a model that is not answering. Cost has a real substitute in the OpenRouter registry; a context window has none the engine can derive, so the engine does not invent one — unset, it reports nothing, which switches the auto-compact gate off there instead of thresholding against a made-up denominator. `agent.ollama.context_window` lets the operator state the window instead. A stated window is not a guess, so with it set both `ctx N%` and the gate work in ollama mode; `_native_context_fields` takes it as `window_override` and skips the `modelUsage` lookup. `$compact` is unaffected. Note `Response.tokens_in` is **not** usable for this — it omits `cache_creation_input_tokens` by design, and on a cold cache that is most of the prompt (22k of 40k on a measured turn), which is exactly the case the feature exists for.

## Persona / cross-backend handoff

- `ensure_persona()` in `agent.py` symlinks a persona into every workspace as both `CLAUDE.md` (for claude) and `AGENTS.md` (for codex) — see `PERSONA_FILENAMES`. The source is `~/.claude-on-the-fly/CLAUDE.md` unless the caller resolved a per-chat one through `agent.persona_for` (Slack channel, Telegram chat, or job key) through its `personas:` table.
- `transcript.py` handles cross-backend handoff: when the daemon switches backends, it parses the prior backend's session JSONL into a single prompt so context carries over. If you're changing session-log paths or output schemas in a backend, this is the file that will break.
- `remove_workspace_sessions()` deletes the session directory claude keys to a workspace path but keeps *outside* it (`~/.claude/projects/<hash>/`) and removes matching Codex mappings from the daemon-owned store.

### Direct Codex diagnostic output

The direct `codex exec` subprocess writes its final reply to stdout and ongoing
narration (including tool output) to stderr. Keep the final reply subject to the
shared 8 MiB cap, but drain stderr continuously and retain only its last 64 KiB
for exit diagnostics. Cumulative narration is not a response-size violation.
The rollout remains the durable execution record. Both readers must be cancelled
and awaited when the turn is cancelled or the stdout cap is exceeded, so a
surviving descendant holding a pipe cannot strand the reader tasks.

        somebody is talking *to* the bot and the missing tag is a slip. Without
        that check this fires on ordinary channel chatter the bot was never part
        of. Called from inside the channel/group branch, so a DM (where no tag is
        needed) can never reach it.

        Narrowed further to people who have tagged. A thread the bot has been
        pulled into carries other conversations: two people answering each other,
        or another app posting. Those are not addressed to the bot and their
        authors never forgot anything, so nudging them is both wrong and, for an
        app, unreadable. Only an untagged message from somebody who tagged in this
        thread is a plausible slip.

        Everyone who tagged counts. Two people can be mid-conversation with the
        bot in one thread, and both can forget; the one who tagged more recently
        has no better claim to the reminder than the other. So the tagger set only
        grows.

        Each slip is told, not only the first. A reminder that gets used up leaves
        the next slip unanswered in a thread the person believes the bot is
        reading, and that thread just stalls. The delay below is what keeps the
        repeats quiet: a burst of untagged messages still collapses into one.
        That makes the delay the only cap on volume, and the cost is deliberate:
        somebody who tagged and then keeps chatting in the thread untagged is
        told after every pause.

        Posted as an ephemeral message, so only the person who forgot sees it.
        The thread stays clean for everyone else, which matters because this fires
        on a mistake and a public correction reads as the bot telling somebody off
        in front of their colleagues. The cost is real and deliberate: Slack drops
        an ephemeral message unless the recipient is active, and clears it when
        they reload, so the one who forgot *and* walked away never gets it. That
        was the case the delay below was built for. Privacy won.

        Opt-in (`slack.mention_notice_seconds`, off by default) and, when on, held
        for that many seconds rather than posted now. Each further untagged
        message restarts the wait: while they are still typing they are also
        still watching, and a notice read on arrival is one they never register.
        While it is off nothing is scheduled and no per-thread state is recorded. A tagged message cancels it outright -- somebody who got
        it right does not need telling -- so this only reaches the person who
        forgot *and* walked away, which is exactly who comes back to an unread

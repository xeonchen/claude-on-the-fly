"""Cross-backend conversation transcript extraction and handoff.

Each agent CLI writes its own session JSONL. When a daemon restarts under a
different backend, we look up the prior backend's transcript for the same
session_uuid and prepend a short handoff preamble to the next user prompt so
context survives the switch.

Public surface:
- `Turn` dataclass
- `extract_claude(workspace, session_uuid)` reads ~/.claude/projects/<hash>/<uuid>.jsonl
- `extract_codex(workspace, session_uuid)` reads the codex rollout matching the
  thread_id persisted in the daemon-owned ~/.claude-on-the-fly/codex-sessions/
  store, outside the agent-writable workspace
- `format_handoff(turns, from_backend)` renders a labeled preamble, capped by
  turn count and char budget from the most recent backward
- `find_latest_prior_transcript(workspace, exclude_uuid)` scans both backends'
  per-workspace session stores and returns (turns, from_backend) for the
  newest one, used to seed handoff after a model/backend switch mints a
  fresh session UUID
- `prepend_latest_handoff(workspace, prompt, exclude_uuid)` higher-level
  wrapper that combines find + format + prepend, swallowing scan errors
- `remove_workspace_sessions(workspace)` deletes the session directory a
  backend keyed to a workspace path but stored outside it

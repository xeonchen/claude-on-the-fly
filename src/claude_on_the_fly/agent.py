    A frontend names a workspace after the conversation, and part of that name
    is a display string somebody else chose: on Slack a trusted bot's per-message
    `username` reaches it verbatim, and Slack does not constrain that field. So
    the value is untrusted even though the frontend supplying it is not.

    The path matters more than a name usually does. It becomes `_PROJECT_DIR`,
    which both jails grant writes to, and the directory above it holds
    `cron.yaml`, whose entries the cron producer runs through a shell with the
    daemon's full environment and no jail. A single `..` would therefore turn a
    workspace name into host code execution outside the sandbox, which is why
    this is not left to the frontends to remember.

    Each component is reduced to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, and a component made only of
    dots becomes `_`. That second rule is the whole traversal defence: `.` and
    `..` are the only names the filesystem reads as navigation, and every other
    use of a dot is an ordinary character in an ordinary filename. The containment
    check afterwards is not redundant with it: it asserts this function's own
    arithmetic held, and it refuses rather than returning a path outside the tree.
    A symlink already standing where the workspace goes fails it too, since
    `resolve()` follows one and the target is then outside.

    The dot is kept rather than reduced with everything else because Slack
    usernames contain them. Measured against a real deployment: of 167 workspaces
    on disk, `keys.safe_segment` would have moved 8, all of the shape
    `dm-first.last-<ts>`. A moved workspace is not cosmetic. The directory holds
    the thread's files, its outbox and its persona link, and claude derives its
    session hash from the working directory, so the conversation would have lost
    its history as well. `keys.safe_segment` is left alone: job keys have no such
    names and want the tighter set.

    `data_dir` is a parameter rather than this module's `DATA_DIR` because each
    caller already holds the one its own module imported, and a frontend under
    test redirects that. A hidden read of the global here would quietly ignore the
    redirection and write into the operator's real data directory.

    turn continued past it, which is a `tool_use`. Whatever is still pending when
    the stream ends is the answer, and is dropped rather than posted twice under a
    progress marker.

    Measured (claude 2.1.220): every assistant message carries exactly ONE
    content block, so the normal shape is `text` in one message and the `tool_use`
    in the next, and "pending across messages" is the main path rather than the
    fallback. A message holding both is rare but must still come out in order,
    which is why the flush happens at the `tool_use` block itself and not after
    the loop: only text that PRECEDED the tool call is proven to be narration, and
    text positioned after it is still a candidate for the final answer.

    Sub-agent output is not in the stream to begin with -- `--forward-subagent-text`
    is off unless asked for, and `_native_base_argv` never asks. The
    `parent_tool_use_id` check is the belt to that braces: the field is present on
    every default-stream assistant line with the value None (measured), and it is
    the field the flag's own help text says subagent forwarding sets.

    Thinking is excluded by selecting `type == "text"`. That filter is
    load-bearing, not defensive: the main agent's own thinking blocks ARE in the
    default stream (measured), each as its own message, and they carry their
    payload under `thinking` -- as `transcript.py` and `tui/session_format.py`

    The process viewing the log (the TUI) isn't necessarily configured for the
    backend that ran the job: the daemon may run codex while the dashboard's
    shell is claude:native. Each backend stores logs in its own tree, and session
    UUIDs are seeded per backend, so a given (workspace, uuid) exists in exactly
    one store — the first hit is unambiguous. Each backend's session_log_path
    only depends on its store location, so the bare constructor is enough.

    Codex is tried last on purpose: claude resolves with a single path stat, but
    codex's no-mapping fallback scans the rollout tree, so we only pay for it
    when the cheap backend misses (a real codex session, or none yet).

"""Default `AgentRunner` — one agent run per job, reusing `agent.run`.

A job with no `session_key` is an independent one-shot: a fresh workspace under
`<platform>/__runs/<uuid>` and a fresh session uuid per call, so no prior
transcript bleeds in. Isolation comes from the uuid, not from any cleanup — the
workspace is new whatever happened to the last one. That is every Slack-triggered
job.

A job that carries a `session_key` is one step of something longer — turn 2 on a
ticket a poller keeps returning — so its workspace and session uuid derive from
that key instead of a random id, and it sits directly under `<platform>/`. The
next job with the same key resumes the same transcript rather than re-deriving
the world from nothing. Both the workspace path and the session uuid include the
key, so nothing else has to be persisted to make the resume happen.

Execution reuses the existing spawn-run-reap path in `agent.run` / backend
`_exec` — no new subprocess or kill code — so a graceful shutdown that cancels
the in-flight task lets `_exec`'s `finally` reap the whole process tree within
the supervisor's grace.

A handled agent failure becomes a `Result(ok=False, ...)`; `CancelledError`
(a `BaseException`, not caught here) still propagates so cancel-in-flight works.

No run deletes a workspace. Finished one-shots are retired later, in bulk, by
`sweep_run_workspaces` at worker startup: it takes the workspace *and* the
session directory the active backend named after it (claude keeps one outside the
workspace), for every `__runs/` entry past the retention window. Keeping them
until then means a run that failed overnight can still be inspected. A keyed
workspace is never swept; it is the continuity.

NOTE (stdin inheritance): `agent._exec` spawns the CLI without passing `stdin=`,
(the codex backend passes DEVNULL itself; this is about the claude path)
so the child inherits this process's stdin. That is harmless for the supervised
worker — `supervisor.spawn` starts daemons with `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` — but
a worker run in the foreground from a terminal hands the agent CLI that terminal's
stdin, and it may consume input meant for the shell. Run the worker detached
(`claude-tui start jobs`), or redirect its stdin, if that matters to you.

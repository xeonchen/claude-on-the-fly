"""Spawn-time sandboxing for agent subprocesses.

Two independent protections, both gated by `sandbox.mode` (default off):

  off  - inherit the full daemon environment, no wrapper. Current behavior,
         zero change for anyone who hasn't opted in.
  env  - curate the environment: forward only an allowlist to the agent, so a
         leaked-into-daemon API key or platform token never reaches it.
         Cross-platform.
  jail - curated env plus the vendored seatbelt jail (macOS): egress locked to
         loopback, keychain reads denied. Profiles are vendored in seatbelt/, so
         no external install is needed.

The agent reaches approved external services through the loopback broker (see
broker.py); base-urls published by the broker survive curation because they end
in _BASE_URL. The real keys never enter this process's child env.

_JAIL_GUIDANCE = """## Sandbox

This session runs under {mechanism} with a credential broker. Some \
operations are blocked by policy. A policy block is not a transient error and \
cannot be worked around with chmod, sudo, or retrying: the only fix is an \
operator configuration change. When you hit one, tell the user the specific \
change needed, then continue with whatever you can still do.

Telling a policy block from a real error:
{errors}
- A network call that cannot connect or resolve, an error tagged "[sandbox] ... \
egress policy", or an HTTP 451 means egress policy. For HTTPS the message arrives \
as a proxy/tunnel error whose status line carries the reason, e.g. "403 Forbidden \
by egress policy: host permanently blocked, cannot be approved" — read that line, \
it says which of these happened and whether retrying can ever help.

Reads and writes have different scopes. Do not narrow reads to the write scope: \
refusing a read you are actually permitted to make costs the user real work.
- Reading: {reads}
- Writing: {writes} Writes elsewhere fail.
- Network: {net} Your model/API access is already routed through the broker via \
*_BASE_URL, so it works without any key from you.

Attempt an operation you believe is in scope rather than declining in advance. \
If policy blocks it you get a clear error and can report that; declining without \
trying tells the user nothing about what is actually possible.

Your working material is this conversation's workspace and its own transcript. \
Other conversations on this host belong to other people and other tasks, and \
their stored sessions are not part of what you were asked to do. If something \
you need genuinely lives in another conversation, ask for it.

Common blocked scenarios and the remedy to relay to the user:
- Reading a file outside the allowed set (e.g. `cat ~/.aws/credentials`) \
{block_read}. Remedy: the operator adds the path to `sandbox.extra_paths`.
- Writing a file outside the workspace {block_write}. Remedy: the operator \
widens the sandbox write profile.
- Reaching an external host that is not yet approved pauses while the operator \
is asked, then either succeeds or returns 403 with an "[sandbox] egress policy" \
body. A 403 means they declined: say which host you needed and why, then carry \
on with what you can. Do not retry in a loop, and do not look for another route \
to the same host.
{keychain}
- {brokered} A credentialed CLI that is not on that list will fail on its own \
config or token file, because the sandbox denies credential stores. That is \
policy, not a broken install, and the remedy is NOT a read grant: adding the \
credential path would either leave the tool broken or hand its token to this \
session. Remedy to relay: the operator adds the tool to the `commands:` section \
of {settings_path}. Report which command you needed and stop there — do not look \
for the credential yourself, and do not reach the same service by another route \
(a different host, another tool's token, a provider-side integration). Doing that \
launders the boundary rather than respecting it."""

    Two of them, and neither has a macOS counterpart because seatbelt expresses
    both with a rule rather than a mount.

    The ssh-agent socket is the sharper one. `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is forwarded to the
    agent on both platforms, and on macOS the socket behind it is unusable
    because the jail profile permits no unix socket at all -- a decision jail.sb
    records as deliberate, since `(remote unix)` is not path-scopeable. A mount
    namespace has the opposite default: `--ro-bind / /` reaches every socket on
    the machine, so a jailed turn could connect to the agent and sign as the
    operator. Found by running one contract against both jails; reading either
    profile would not have shown it.

    The `.env` sweep covers the daemon's own secrets landing beneath a granted
    subtree. The data dir is opaque, but `memory/` is granted back read-write, so
    a `.env` inside it reappears. Seatbelt covers this with one regex over the
    whole data dir; there is no pattern matching here, so the files are resolved
    now. Glob rather than an exact name because the macOS regex is unanchored at
    the end and so already covers `.env.bak` and friends -- which is the shape a
    backup taken before an edit actually has.

    An operator grant needs the same sweep for a sharper reason. `sandbox.extra_paths`
    names a directory an operator added for real reasons, which is exactly where a
    token file sits beside the files they wanted granted, and the grant is a
    read-only bind over the whole tree. `_extra_path_refusal` does not catch it:
    that check mirrors the profile's own read denies, which had no rule for a

      1. The jail runs a trivial command. Catches a missing mechanism, a profile

         and until now nothing checked it on either platform. A jail whose network
         rules silently did not apply looks exactly like one whose did.

    So the agent's own blocked reads are unobservable from this side, permanently.
    A broken profile or readable credential path is therefore a startup failure,
    not a warning after which autonomous work continues.

    What *is* observable is whether the boundary was in force, which this answers

    Three outcomes, not two, and the distinction is the whole point. An absent
    path is *not* evidence of anything: this machine simply has no credential
    there, and folding it into "denied" would let a run where every store happens
    to be missing report a boundary it never tested. Only DENIED is proof.

    UNTESTED is fatal and ABSENT is not, and the line between them is what the
    host told us *outside* the jail. ABSENT means the file is genuinely not on
    this machine, so there is no credential at that path to leak; combined with
    `preflight`, which has already proven the jail starts, refuses egress and can
    write its session store, an all-absent run is a bare host rather than an
    unverified boundary. UNTESTED means the opposite: the file is there, it is
    the kind of file this exists to protect, and the one question that mattered
    went unanswered. `preflight` is already fatal on the same spawn failures, so
    this being lenient about them was the anomaly, not the fix.

    One function because the order is load-bearing and easy to get wrong from a
    call site: `preflight` proves the jail runs and holds its egress deny, and
    `verify_denials` proves the credential reads are refused. The first is what
    makes the second's silence meaningful, since a jail that never started would
    otherwise report a clean sheet.

    It exists as its own name because for a while `orchestrator._start_sandbox`
    was the only caller of either, so the chat daemon refused to serve on a jail
    that could not hold `state/` while the job worker kept draining the queue
    across the same unverified boundary. Any future daemon that reaches
    `agent.run` calls this, and calls it before it claims work.

    Inert unless `sandbox.mode` is `jail`: both halves return early otherwise, so
    an `off` or `env` deployment pays nothing and starts exactly as before.

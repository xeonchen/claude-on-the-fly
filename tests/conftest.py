# Redirect HOME before anything else runs. Module constants like

# package freezes whatever home is current — after that, patching the
# environment redirects nothing. Any import can reach the package transitively,
# so every one of them is deliberately ordered below this block — hence the E402
# suppressions on the two that end up below the assignments. With the real home
# out of reach, no production path can resolve into the developer's live
# `~/.claude-on-the-fly/`, where a worker daemon owns the job maildir.

# Contain os.killpg for the whole suite.
#
# Production code reaps an agent CLI with `os.killpg(proc.pid, SIGKILL)`, which
# is correct there: those children are spawned with start_new_session=True, so
# the pid *is* a process-group id. Under test the same call receives pids that
# are not. A `MagicMock` proc is the common case, and `os.killpg` resolves it
# through `__index__`, which MagicMock answers with **1** -- so the call becomes
# `killpg(1, SIGKILL)`, a real signal aimed at a real process group.
#
# Where that lands decides whether the suite survives. On a developer macOS box
# and on a GitHub runner it is EPERM, so nothing happens and nobody notices. In
# a container whose pytest sits in the targeted group it kills the test run
# outright. A test that spawns a child without a new session can likewise hand
# over a pid whose group is pytest's own.
#
# Refusing those two shapes costs no coverage: every caller already treats an
# OSError from killpg as "the group is gone, fall back to proc.kill()", which is
# the branch these tests want to exercise anyway. A genuinely detached group --
# what tests/jobs/test_orphans.py creates on purpose -- is still signalled for
# real, because that is the behaviour under test.
